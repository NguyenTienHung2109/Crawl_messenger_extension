# SendGrid Email Verification Guide

## Current Status
✅ Code implementation: **CORRECT**
✅ API Key format: **VALID** (SG.xxx.xxx)
❌ Sender email: **NOT VERIFIED** (causes 403 Forbidden)

## Issue Analysis

The 403 Forbidden error from SendGrid indicates:
- Your API key is valid and working
- But the sender email `hunghn2003@gmail.com` is not verified in your SendGrid account
- SendGrid requires sender verification to prevent spam

## Step-by-Step Verification Process

### 1. Login to SendGrid
1. Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/login
2. Login with your SendGrid account credentials

### 2. Navigate to Sender Authentication
1. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Sender Authentication**
3. Look for the **Single Sender Verification** section

### 3. Verify Your Email
You have two options:

#### Option A: If you see "hunghn2003@gmail.com" listed but unverified:
1. Click the **Resend Verification** button next to the email
2. Check your Gmail inbox for `hunghn2003@gmail.com`
3. Look for email from SendGrid (check Spam folder if not in Inbox)
4. Click the verification link in the email
5. You'll see a success message in your browser

#### Option B: If "hunghn2003@gmail.com" is not listed:
1. Click **Create New Sender** button
2. Fill in the form:
   - **From Name:** Refinitiv Messenger Bot
   - **From Email Address:** hunghn2003@gmail.com
   - **Reply To:** hunghn2003@gmail.com (or another email)
   - **Company Address:** (fill in any valid address)
   - **City:** (your city)
   - **Country:** (your country)
3. Click **Create**
4. Check your Gmail inbox for verification email
5. Click the verification link

### 4. Confirm Verification Status
After clicking the verification link:
1. Return to SendGrid dashboard → Settings → Sender Authentication
2. You should see `hunghn2003@gmail.com` with a **Verified** status (green checkmark)

## Testing After Verification

### 1. Restart the Email Service
On the server, restart the Flask application:
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
python server.py
```

### 2. Wait for Email Collection Interval
The email service runs every 5 minutes (configured in email_config.json).

Or you can manually trigger a test by:
1. Sending some test messages in Refinitiv Messenger
2. Wait for the next 5-minute interval
3. Check the server logs for email status

### 3. Check Server Logs
Look for these messages in the server console:
```
✅ SUCCESS: Email sent via SendGrid successfully!
Response: 202 Accepted
```

Instead of:
```
❌ Error sending email via SendGrid: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden
```

### 4. Check Recipient Inboxes
After successful sending, check these email addresses:
- tienhungnguyen2109@gmail.com
- trongnq5@msb.com.vn

Look for emails with subject: "Refinitiv Messenger Data Summary - [timestamp]"

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get 403 after verification:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes - SendGrid may need time to propagate the verification
2. Double-check the email in SendGrid matches exactly: `hunghn2003@gmail.com`
3. Make sure you clicked the verification link (not just read the email)
4. Try generating a new API key in SendGrid and update email_config.json

### If you get 401 Unauthorized:
- API key is invalid or expired
- Generate a new API key in SendGrid → Settings → API Keys
- Update the `sendgrid_api_key` in email_config.json

### If you get other errors:
- Check SendGrid account status (not suspended/limited)
- Verify you have remaining email quota in your free tier
- Check SendGrid Activity Feed for detailed error messages
